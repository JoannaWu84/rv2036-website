# Jiachen Project - RISC-V Prosperity 2036

## Background

Today, the RISC-V ecosystem has entered a phase of exponential growth. In the past 18 months, RISC-V has seen breakthrough in high performance server chips, desktop operating systems, mobile and wearable devices, AIoT, automotive systems, information security, and many other fields. In 2025, we expect to see the number of developers growing past a million and RISC-V super computers will enter the TOP500 list (with TOP10 projected for 2030).

With the development of computer architecture and foundational software platforms entering a “golden age” of rapid growth, open instruction set architectures such as RISC-V brought forth new scientific problems and engineering challenges. As leading contributors to the RISC-V ecosystem, we invite friends and experts around the globe to join us in this long-term collective effort to realize the goals of RISC-V Prosperity 2036.

## Vision & Mission

2024 is the year of the dragon, with 2036 coming up as the next.

RISC-V Prosperity 2036 aims to realize a mature RISC-V’s hardware and software ecosystem akin to that of the other mainstream architectures by the next year of the dragon, 2036. This means mainstream-level maturity in applications such as datacenters, desktop computing, wearable technologies, and Internet of things - all implemented with systems of open standards and open source system software stacks.

## Goals

1. Bringing a joint effort of over 100 chip and solutions manufacturers and over 500 software development firms, in order to port, optimize, and deploy over 1,000 key commercial software packages across 18 essential industries.
2. Developing solutions suitable for commercial applications around high-performance RISC-V chips and IPs such as SG2380 and XiangShan, helping our target industries. These industries include AI acceleration, edge computing, storage, robotics, computer-assisted industrial simulation, computer-assisted medical solutions, and many more.
3. Building a human resource development effort for RISC-V to network over 10,000 potential experts in RISC-V chip design, software development, community management, as well as education and training. This will allow us to enable a industry-wide human resource network.
